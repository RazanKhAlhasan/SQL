# SQL (Structured Query Language) 🌟

SQL is a programming language specifically designed for managing relational databases. 
Its primary purpose is to perform tasks related to querying, manipulating, and managing data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). 

## Here are the key aspects of SQL:

### 1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** 
DDL statements are responsible for defining and managing the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. Common DDL statements include CREATE (to create objects), ALTER (to modify objects), and DROP (to remove objects).

### 2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** 
DML statements are used to manipulate the data within the database. With DML, you can perform operations like SELECT (to retrieve data), INSERT (to add new data), UPDATE (to modify existing data), and DELETE (to remove data).

### 3. **Data Control Language (DCL):** 
DCL statements are utilized to control access to the database and manage user privileges. GRANT is used to grant permissions to users, while REVOKE is used to revoke those permissions.

### 4. **Data Query Language (DQL):** 
DQL statements allow you to retrieve specific data from the database. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which enables you to specify the columns and conditions to filter and retrieve the desired data.
