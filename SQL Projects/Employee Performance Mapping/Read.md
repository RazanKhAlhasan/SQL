## Project Description üë©‚Äçüè´
Generate reports on employee details, their performance, and the projects they have been involved in. These reports will help the HR department analyze the employee database and extract specific data based on different requirements.
To facilitate a better understanding of employee performance, managers have provided performance ratings for each employee.
In this project we will find the maximum salary among employees, ensure that all job positions meet the organization's profile standards, calculate bonuses to determine additional expenses, and identify employees who require training to improve overall performance.
